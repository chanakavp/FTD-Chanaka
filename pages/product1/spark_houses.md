## What is a house??
The House System is a traditional feature of many schools in commonwealth countries. ?Upon joining the school, each student is inducted into one of the houses. The house system is a time-tested method of grafting new students into the school culture, as well as expanding the boundaries of fellowship across all grades. We're leveraging this system to create our own fellowship.

## What is a 'Fortude House'?
A Fortude House is a cross integration team which represents Fortudites from different time zones, geographies, and teams, who will compete and win points for their houses.

## Why 'Fortude Houses'?
To build connections within Fortudites across different time zones, geographies, and different teams by uniting Fortudites to 'Deliver Solutions that Matter.'
Nurture team behaviors such as cooperation, commitment, ownership, and trust.
Form an informal network to improve and encourage communication.
And, most importantly, to HAVE FUN!
