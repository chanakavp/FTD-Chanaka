<p>The House System is a traditional feature of many schools in commonwealth countries. ?Upon joining the school, each student is inducted into one of the houses. The house system is a time-tested method of grafting new students into the school culture, as well as expanding the boundaries of fellowship across all grades. Weâ€™re leveraging this system to create our own fellowship.</p>
